          Fitt's Law states that the bigger an object is, and the closer it is,
          the easier it is to use. This page fits this description, because
          there is a big button right at the bottom of the screen when you open
          the website. It isn’t completely overpowering, but the red circle does
          draw your attention to it. Most websites have been updated for the
          current time we are in, with the pandemic and the economic impacts.
          This website wants you to click on this link to easily go to a place
          to learn how to support small business right now. This website is very
          clean and classy, and they didn’t want to detract from that with a
          giant circle filled in with red, so they went a little more subtle,
          but equally as impactful in my opinion.

          Hick’s Law says that with every additional choice it increases the
          time required to take a decision. When we have too many choices, we
          get paralyzed and can’t make a decision, so we don’t make any
          decisions. In web design, this means that the website design must be
          clean and simple, and don’t give too many options. On this Ivory Homes
          home page, I liked that when I first get to the page, there are only 4
          options right in front of me. Normally this seems like the navigation
          and wouldn’t be proper to have it so prominent on the page. But it
          works for this site, because each user is coming for something
          different, and this is a very easy way to navigate them to what they
          are looking for.

        <h2>Proximity</h2>

        <p>
          Proximity is how you place items and content on a page to establish a
          relationship between the items. When things are closer together, our
          brains connect the items together into a group. I liked this page, it
          was clean and simple, and uses the proximity principle perfectly. The
          icons are above each item, and the couple of lines of text are grouped
          together. Then there is enough space between them so you know that
          they are separate items. You don’t have to wonder if the icon goes
          with the text above or below it, because it is obviously with the text
          below it.

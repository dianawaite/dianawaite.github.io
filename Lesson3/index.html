      <h2 class="font2">Site Purpose</h2>
      <p>The people in the small towns of Preston, Fish Haven, and Soda Springs, Idaho are in need of a 
        place to go online to see what the weather is going to be like in their area. Bigger websites ignore these
        small towns, so they need something specific to their area. There is alot of outdoor recreation in the area, so it
        is important for them to be able to check the weather and see what is happening. This site will also be a community
        site for local events and attractions. It will function like a small-town newspaper from 100 years ago, where everyone
        went for their local news and information about the happenings in their towns.

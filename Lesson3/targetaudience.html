<p class="font2"> 
  The target audience for this website is the people of the small towns of Preston, Fish Haven, and Soda Springs, Idaho. 
  This site will function similarly to how a small town newspaper used to many years ago. They will be able to come to this site
  for community news and weather, including local events.

<h3 class="font2">Personas</h3>
<p>A 30-year-old mother of 3, living in Preston, ID with her husband. She likes to take her children to the park but likes to know
  what the weather will be like before she goes. She also likes to know what is going on in her town, so she can come to this site
  to see the events coming up. She usually checks these things from her phone.
</p>
<hr>
<p>A 55-year-old grandpa who lives in Fish Haven on a small ranch. He loves to have his grandchildren come over and help him around
  the yard and house and then they have a great time playing in the creek. But he likes to check the weather to make sure all will be well. 
  He also likes to submit stories about his grandchildren to be published on the website.
